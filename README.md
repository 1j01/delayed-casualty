# [Delayed Causality](http://1j01.github.io/delayed-causality/) (working title)

A simple fighter what with swords and death and all

You can attack and block. One hit kills.

There are no combos to memorize.
There are no meters.
You don't even need to try to face the other player.

If only one person manages to connect with an attack, they succeed obviously,
but if both players connect, one will win based on...

1. timing: you want to hit as soon as the other player comes within your swing radius
2. angle: you want to be higher up than the other player
3. speed: you want to be moving faster than the other player
4. blocking: a block that connects always succeeds, but damages your sword
5. character attributes that affect the amounts that the above factor in

Wall movement:

* press away from a wall to do a long jump
* up to do a high jump (still kicking away a bit)
* up and away to jump up and away more
* up and towards it to wall-climb
* and down to fall downwards
