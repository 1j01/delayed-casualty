# [Delayed Causality](http://1j01.github.io/delayed-causality/) (working title)

A simple fighter what with swords and death and all

You can attack and block. One hit kills.
If only one person manages to connect with a block or attack, they succeed obviously,
but if both players connect, one will win based on...

1. timing: you want to hit as soon as the other player comes within your swing radius
2. angle: you want to be higher up than the other player
3. speed: you want to be moving faster than the other player
4. whether a player is blocking
5. character attributes that affect the amounts that the above factor in
