A swordfighting game with simple but unique mechanics.

There are no combos to memorize.
There are no meters.
You don't have to face the other player,
except in the sense that you're dueling.

You can attack and parry.
One hit kills.
But who dies?

If you fail to either block or attack back, you die, naturally.
If you block, you'll survive, but your sword will be damaged.
But if both players connect and attack in a clash,
one will win based on...

1. timing: you want to hit as soon as your opponent comes within your swing radius
2. angle: you want to be higher up than your opponent
3. speed: you want to be moving faster than your opponent
<!-- 4. potentially, character attributes that affect the amounts that the above factor in -->

Wall movement:

* press away from a wall to do a long jump
* up to do a high jump (still kicking away a bit)
* up and away to jump up and away more
* up and towards the wall to wall-climb
* hold down to fall downwards
