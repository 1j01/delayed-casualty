You can attack and block. One hit kills.
If only one person manages to connect with a block or attack, they would succeed obviously
but if both players connect, one would win based on...

1. angle: you want to be higher up than the other player
2. timing: you want to hit as soon as the other player comes within your swing radius
3. speed: you want to be moving faster than the other player
4. character attributes that affect the amounts that the above factors factor in as factors probably with factors (factor factors, like factors of factors y'know? yeah, clear.)

Like Lethal League does really well,
the characters should seem aesthetic at first,
but as you play with them you start to notice significant differences.

Movement: supposed to be slower paced than LL

like wall jumps will have you stick to walls for some time and whatnot.

You should automatically kick off of a wall after some time,
but you can control how by the key(s) you press;
away to do a long jump,
up to do a high jump (and away a bit),
up and away to jump up and away more,
and down to fall downwards,
the default being to kick off and go downwards at an angle.

If there's some kind of tie (draw/timeout.. maybe BOTH swords break at the same time both blocking??)
there can be a sudden death final standoff/JUMPoff more like it HEH,
with the jumping and slice-a-dicing and a no-no to the blocking.

If both players attack and they get the same strike power they can both die

* characters
	* two hit wonder
		* two swords
		* average power higher for two successful hits, lower for one
		* due to delay, you generally have to hit on both sides of the circle of attack to be effective
	* the bamboozler
		* wields bamboo
		* staff can be cut off at one or two points, so very little durability
		* could be dynamic, being cut off based on the attacker's distance, which should encourage
		* low damage probably
	* knife guy
		* really shit weapon
		* is there any reason this should exist?
		* yes
		* to show how pro u are
	* bird guy
		* can slow himself down in the air (very well)
		* does he glide when he does that?
		* just better air control in general
	* big guy
		* big sword
		* good block, long delay?

* matching areas for each character?

* input
	* a library for (especially multiplayer) gamepad and keyboard(/+mouse) assignment and remapping, including UI

* screens
	* title
	* pause
	* settings
		* controls
		* volume(s)
