## Movement

It's supposed to be slower paced than Lethal League.

You'll stick to walls for wall jumps, and automatically kick off of a wall after some time,
but you can control how (and probably do it earlier) by with the movement keys:

* press away from the wall to do a long jump,
* up to do a high jump (still kicking away a bit),
* up and away to jump up and away more,
* and down to fall downwards,
* the default being to kick off and go downwards at an angle.

* Input
	* A library for (especially multiplayer) gamepad and keyboard(/+mouse) assignment and remapping, including UI
	* Allow early inputs where appropriate

* Slow things down
* Ledge grabbing

## Fighting

* Clash outcomes
	* WIN/LOSE
		* one player fails to attack or block
		* one player wins the power contest
	* DRAW
		* a player successfully blocks
		* both players block
	* LEATHAL DRAW
		* both players attack with (approximately) the same hit power
		* both players block and BOTH swords break

* Special match outcomes
	* WIN/LOSE
		* a player falls into an abyss
	* DRAW
		* time runs out (should a timer always be visible, or should it maybe only appear after a while?)
	* LEATHAL DRAW
		* both players fall into an abyss

If the match is a draw,
there can be a sudden death final standoff/JUMPoff more like it HEH,
with the jumping and the slice-a-dicing and not so much of the blocking.

## Characters

Like Lethal League does really well,
the characters should seem aesthetic at first,
but as you play with them you start to notice significant differences.

* characters
	* two hit wonder
		* two swords
		* average power higher for two successful hits, lower for one
		* due to delay, you generally have to hit on both sides of the circle of attack to be effective
	* the bamboozler
		* wields bamboo
		* staff can be cut off at one or two points, so very little durability
		* could be dynamic, being cut off based on the attacker's distance, which should encourage
		* low damage probably
	* knife guy
		* really shit weapon
		* is there any reason this should exist?
		* yes
		* to show how pro u are
	* bird guy
		* can slow himself down in the air (very well)
		* does he glide when he does that?
		* just better air control in general
	* big guy
		* big sword
		* good block, long delay?

* Matching areas for each character?

## Misc

* Screens
	* Title
	* Pause
	* Settings
		* Controls
		* SFX volume
		* Music volume
	* Credits
