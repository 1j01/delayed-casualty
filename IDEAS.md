* You can attack and block.

one hit always kills, probably, almost definitely
and if only one person manages to connect with a block or attack, they would succeed obviously
but if both players connect, one would win based on

1. angle: you want to be higher up than the other player
2. timing: you want to hit as soon as the other player comes within your swing radius
3. speed: you want to be moving faster than the other player
4. character attributes that affect the amounts that the above factors factor in as factors probably with factors (factor factors, like factors of factors y'know? yeah, clear.)

characters like Lethal League does really well,
the characters should seem aesthetic at first,
but as you play with them you start to realize subtle but significant differences

movement: supposed to be slower paced than LL
like wall jumps will have you stick to walls for some time and whatnot
there should probably be control over your wall jumps so you can like jump downwards maybe idk
like if you're going to stick to walls for a period of time we could have it where you're *going* to jump off,
but you can control how by the key(s) you press
right to jump of right, up to jump up (and away), up and away to jump up and away more, down to barely kick off and mostly fall, etc. or that could be the default or whatever
we can figure out whatever is natural and good to have

and anyways the last thing is if there's some kind of tie (draw/timeout.. maybe BOTH swords break at the same time both blocking??)
there can be a sudden death final standoff/JUMPoff more like it HEH, with the jumping and slice-a-dicing and no-no-no to the blocking

note: screenshots leaked here: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle

if both players attack and they get the same strike power they can both die
