You can attack and block. One hit kills.
If only one person manages to connect with a block or attack, they would succeed obviously
but if both players connect, one would win based on...

1. angle: you want to be higher up than the other player
2. timing: you want to hit as soon as the other player comes within your swing radius
3. speed: you want to be moving faster than the other player
4. character attributes that affect the amounts that the above factors factor in as factors probably with factors (factor factors, like factors of factors y'know? yeah, clear.)

Like Lethal League does really well,
the characters should seem aesthetic at first,
but as you play with them you start to notice significant differences.

Movement: supposed to be slower paced than LL

like wall jumps will have you stick to walls for some time and whatnot.

You should automatically kick off of a wall after some time,
but you can control how by the key(s) you press;
away to do a long jump,
up to do a high jump (and away a bit),
up and away to jump up and away more,
and down to fall downwards,
the default being to kick off and go downwards at an angle.

If there's some kind of tie (draw/timeout.. maybe BOTH swords break at the same time both blocking??)
there can be a sudden death final standoff/JUMPoff more like it HEH,
with the jumping and slice-a-dicing and a no-no to the blocking.

If both players attack and they get the same strike power they can both die
